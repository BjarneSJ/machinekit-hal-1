The error message "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting." indicates that Git is unable to simply update your local branch to the latest version of the remote branch using a fast-forward merge. This means that there are some conflicts between your local commits and the remote commits.

To resolve this issue, you will need to perform a merge or a rebase. A merge will create a new commit that combines your local changes with the remote changes, while a rebase will rewrite your local history to make it appear as if your changes were made on top of the remote branch.

Here are the steps to resolve the issue using a merge:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote branch:

```
git fetch origin
```

2. Merge the remote branch into your local branch:

```
git merge origin/master
```

3. Resolve any merge conflicts:

If there are any merge conflicts, you will need to manually resolve them. This typically involves editing files to merge the conflicting changes together.

4. Push your merged changes to the remote branch:

```
git push origin master
```

Here are the steps to resolve the issue using a rebase:

1. Checkout the master branch:

```
git checkout master
```

2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote branch:

```
git fetch origin
```

3. Rebas your local commits onto the remote branch:

```
git rebase origin/master
```

4. Resolve any rebase conflicts:

If there are any rebase conflicts, you will need to manually resolve them. This typically involves editing files to modify the rebased commits.

5. Force push your rebased changes to the remote branch:

```
git push origin HEAD --force
```

Please note that forcing a push can overwrite other people's work, so it should be used with caution.

I hope this helps!
